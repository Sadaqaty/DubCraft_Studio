## Troubleshooting
**Common Issues & Solutions:**

- **Missing Models:**
  - Make sure you have downloaded all required models for faster-whisper, pyannote-audio, and Tortoise-TTS/Bark. See their documentation for model download instructions.
  - For pyannote-audio diarization, set the `PYANNOTE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.
- **ffmpeg Errors:**
  - Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and available in your system PATH. On Linux, install with `sudo apt install ffmpeg`. On Windows/Mac, download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
- **PyQt6 Multimedia Issues:**
  - If audio/video preview does not work, ensure you have the `PyQt6.QtMultimedia` package and all system dependencies for multimedia playback.
- **TTS/Voice Issues:**
  - Make sure your Tortoise/Bark voices are in the correct directory (see `TORTOISE_VOICES_DIR` env variable).
- **GPU/CPU Issues:**
  - Some models require a GPU for fast processing. If you encounter out-of-memory or device errors, try using a smaller model or run on CPU.
- **Other Errors:**
  - Check the Logs panel for detailed error messages. If you need help, open an issue on GitHub with your log output.
